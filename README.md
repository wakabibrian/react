# What is React?

Official Web Page: https://react.dev/
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
You don't have to wait for web pages to load, just like mobile apps.

-   It uses JavaScript on the browser to update the page without reloading the page.
-   JavaScript runs in the background

## Why not use only JavaScript?

-   It quickly becomes cumbersome (large or heavy and therefore difficult to carry or use).
-   It quickly becomes error-prone.
-   It quickly becomes hard to maintain or edit.
-   React offers a way simpler "mental model".

React is good for building complex user interfaces for complex applications like Netflix web app.
